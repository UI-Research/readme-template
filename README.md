# GitHub README template 

**Instructions**: This template is intended to provide an example of sections to include in a GitHub repository and suggested content for those sections. This README is generally intended to be programming language and framework agnostic, but not all sections will be relevant to every project. You are highly encouraged to add, update, and remove sections based on your use case.
